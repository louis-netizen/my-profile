            <p>
                Originally from Orange, a small town not far from Marseille, I am now in my 3rd year at Kedge Business School as part of my bachelor's degree in start-up, entrepreneurship, and business transfer. I'm going to tell you about my three passions, which are wine, antiques, and entrepreneurship.

            <h2>Wine</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was little, I grew up surrounded by vineyards. I live in a region where we drink and grow a lot of wine, so this passion for wine came from my surroundings and culture. I also have a taste for good meats, and I must admit that the two go well together.

        <div class="card-white">
            <h2>Antiquity</h2>
            <p>
                For me, antiques are a part of our history but also represent tasteful decorative objects. My father is a big collector of antiques or other objects that are sometimes useless and imperfect, but I see it as a treasure hunt. When I was little, I often went to flea markets to find the best object at the best price, which was exciting, especially when you make a good deal. It is one of my passions that complements collecting valuable objects.

        <div class="card-white">
            <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p>
                For me, entrepreneurship is one of my passions. In our generation, I find it incredible to be able to participate in innovation, whether itâ€™s our project or someone else's, working for yourself or in a start-up. This is exceptional because it shows that today we can be freer and less dependent on others. Even if there is a chance to fail, what matters is having been free and having had fun. This is why entrepreneurship is an opportunity for me.
